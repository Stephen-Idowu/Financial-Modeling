A financial model is a spreadsheet that is built with Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet tools.

The purpose of a financial model is to help in forecasting the possible outcome 

of the financial performance of a business based on given assumptions and drivers. 

Usually previous historical financial records will be needed before a financial model can be built.

The financial records of a business can be seen in the following financial statements

1. Income Statement

2. Balance Sheet

3. Statement of Cash Flow

Each of the above financial statement contains specific information that shows 
financial health of the business or an organzation.
